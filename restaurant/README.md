## General Information
This Restaurant Management System can aid restaurants in streamlining their different processes.
It simplifies a wide variety of processes for the waiters, kitchen staff, and even customers. 
The most crucial aspect of this project is that it simplifies the ordering process for every entity.
A customer can make an order to their table. This order is then automatically assigned to a single
waiter to prevent confusion. This waiter will be responsible for delivering the order to the table,
and assisting the customer if they ask for help. 

Once an order has been confirmed, the kitchen staff
get a notification with the timestamp (to ensure that customers receive their orders in timely fashion), 
and they are able to "start cooking" it. Once it has been cooked, the kitchen staff can mark it as "ready",
which will notify the waiter to deliver to the customer. Once it has been delivered, the waiter can mark the order
as complete. 

This project has a wide spectrum of functionalities, which are expanded on in the [Features](#features) section.
